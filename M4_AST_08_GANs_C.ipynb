        "\n",
        "Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "Takes a random distribution as input (typically Gaussian) and outputs some data\n",
        "typically, an image. We can think of the random inputs as the latent representations (i.e., codings) of the image to be generated. So, as we can see, the generator offers the same functionality as a decoder in a variational autoencoder, and it can be used in the same way to generate new images (just feed it some Gaussian noise, and it outputs a brand-new image).\n",

        "During training, the generator and the discriminator have opposite goals: the discriminator tries to tell fake images from real images, while the generator tries to produce images that look real enough to trick the discriminator. Since, the GAN is composed of two networks with different objectives, it cannot be trained like a regular neural network and its training iteration is divided into two phases:\n",

        "* In the first phase, we train the *discriminator*. A batch of real images is sampled from the training set and is completed with an equal number of fake images produced by the generator. The labels are set to 0 for fake images and 1 for real images, and the discriminator is trained on this labeled batch for one step, using the binary cross-entropy loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In the second phase, we train the *generator*. We first use it to produce another batch of fake images, and once again the discriminator is used to tell whether the images are fake or real. This time we do not add real images in the batch, and all the labels are set to 1 (real): in other words, we want the generator to produce images that the discriminator will (wrongly) believe to be real.\n",

In fact, DCGANs can learn quite meaningful latent representation. As we can see in Figure 2 below: many images were generated, and nine of them were picked manually (top left), including three representing men with glasses, three men without glasses, and three women without glasses. For each of these categories, the codings that were used to generate the images were averaged, and an image was generated based on the resulting mean codings (lower left). In short, each of the three lower-left images represents the mean of the three images located above it. But this is not a simple mean computed at the pixel level (this would result in three overlapping faces), it is a mean computed in the latent space, so the images still look like normal faces. Amazingly, if we compute men with glasses, minus men without glasses, plus women without glasses—where each term corresponds to one of the mean codings and we generate the image that corresponds to this coding, we get the image at the center of the 3 × 3 grid of faces on the right: a woman with glasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer: It would seem that you just need to train the GAN for long enough, and it will eventually reach this equilibrium, giving you a perfect generator. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple: nothing guarantees that the equilibrium will ever be reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The biggest difficulty is called mode collapse: this is when the generator’s outputs gradually become less diverse. How can this happen? Suppose that the generator gets better at producing convincing shoes than any other class. It will fool the discriminator a bit more with shoes, and this will encourage it to produce even more images of shoes. Gradually, it will forget how to produce anything else. Meanwhile, the only fake images that the discriminator will see will be shoes, so it will also forget how to discriminate fake images of other classes. Eventually, when the discriminator manages to discriminate the fake shoes from the real ones, the generator will be forced to move to another class. It may then become good at shirts, forgetting about shoes, and the discriminator will follow. The GAN may gradually cycle across a few classes, never really becoming very good at any of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Moreover, because the generator and the discriminator are constantly pushing against each other, their parameters may end up oscillating and becoming unstable. Training may begin properly, then suddenly diverge for no apparent reason, due to these instabilities. And since many factors affect these complex dynamics, GANs are very sensitive to the hyperparameters: you may have to spend a lot of effort fine-tuning them.\n",
